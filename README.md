## Hangman game

Simply coded in html & javascript 

## Jupyter Notebook

`nltk.corpus.words` is used to generate the words used in the hangman game.

### Note:

Some hard coding in line 199:  
```
var newsrc = hangman_img.src.slice(0, 61).concat("/hangman", String(newindex), ".jpg");
```
where the the slice is the length of current work directory.
