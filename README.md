# hangman project

## background
Coded in html, javascript.  
Maybe I will learn css one day to prettify this app.

## how to play
1. Run the file `index.html`.
2. Select `difficulty`.
3. Press `Start playing` button.
4. A random word is generated...guess the word by pressing the respective alphabet buttons.

## additional info
There are 150 different words in each of the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard & Impossible).  
These words are randomly selected from the nltk words corpus.  
Easy: 6-7 letters  
Medium: 8-10 letters  
Hard: 11-14 letters  
Impossible: 15+ letters  

Impossible is the most fun to play.
